Theme Overview Details:

· Theme name needs to be MovieSpot

Theme Technical Requirements:

You need to create a custom template that will have the following filter functionality:

· Filter by Genre

· Filter by Release Year

· Filter by Publisher

· Sort by Rating

Any of these filters need to work in relation to each other. For example if you choose a Comedy Genre & Release year to be 2020, then all the comedy movies from the year 2020 should be displayed on the page.

Filters should work without page reload, and results need to be sortable by rating from lowest to highest & vice-versa.

Filters should work only for logged in users.

The Author must be able to answer questions about functions and structure of the project.
